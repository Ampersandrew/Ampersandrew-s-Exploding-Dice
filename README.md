# Ampersandrew's Exploding Dice

A Foundry VTT module for adding 'ex' as a dice modifier to explode dice like Deadlands Classic.

This is a fork of Deadlands Classic Dice Explosion by RhombusWeasel.

This module differs for that one as it does not merely keep the highest result, but returns them all. Foundry VTT has a k1 mechanism that may be used to keep only the highest result. Since the original module only returned the vbalue of one die, it did not matter that its implementation added in an extra die for each explosion. When not keeping a single die, adding in these exta dice means each explosion adds twice the number of sides to the result.
